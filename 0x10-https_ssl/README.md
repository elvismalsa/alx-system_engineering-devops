# HTTPS SSL

HTTPS, is the safe version of the communication protocol used on the internet (HTTP). It ensures that when you share information with a website, like passwords or credit card details, it gets scrambled for protection during the journey.

SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is the technology behind HTTPS. It uses digital certificates and encryption to create a secure path for data to travel. Even though SSL is technically old, people often use "SSL" and "HTTPS" interchangeably.

> Think of it like sending a letter. With HTTP, it's like using a regular envelope that anyone can open. With HTTPS, it's like using a locked box sealed with a digital stamp. The recipient needs the right key to unlock the box and access the information.

Benefits of HTTPS:
-------------------

   - Safeguards sensitive information
   - Prevents data breaches
   - Builds user trust
   - Boosts website ranking in search engines

In a nutshell, HTTPS SSL are vital for secure online communication. When you spot `"**https://**"` and a `green lock icon`, your data is in good hands.
