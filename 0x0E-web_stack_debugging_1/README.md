# <p align="center">Web stack debugging #1</p>

- this involves identifying and fixing issues at various levels of the web development stack, including the front end, back end, and the server.

## How to approach web stack debugging:

### <p align="center">Back-End Debugging:</p>

1. Server Logs:

      	> Check server logs for errors and warnings.<br>
       	> Analyze logs to identify patterns or specific issues.

2. Database Debugging:

       	> Ensure database connections are established correctly.<br>
       	> Check database logs for errors.<br>
       	> Verify that database queries are returning the expected results.

3. API Testing:

       	> Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.<br>
       	> Inspect API responses for errors and unexpected behavior.

4. Code Profiling:

       	> Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your server-side code.<br>
       	> Profile database queries and optimize slow-performing queries.

### <p align="center">Infrastructure Debugging:</p>

1. Server Configuration:

	> Verify server configurations for web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx).<br>
	> Check for any misconfigurations that may lead to issues.

2. Load Balancing:

	> If applicable, check load balancing configurations.<br>
	> Ensure that requests are distributed evenly among server instances.

3. Firewall and Security:

	> Check firewall settings for any restrictions.<br>
	> Verify that security configurations are not blocking legitimate requests.

4. Resource Monitoring:

	> Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to identify resource-related issues.<br>
	> Use tools like top or server monitoring services.
