# Webstack monitoring

Webstack monitoring involves the continuous tracking and analysis of various components within a web application's technology stack to ensure optimal performance, availability, and reliability. This comprehensive monitoring approach covers multiple layers of the webstack, including the infrastructure (servers, network), operating system, web server, database, and application code. Monitoring tools gather data on key metrics such as response times, error rates, resource utilization, and user interactions.

The goal is to proactively identify issues, troubleshoot bottlenecks, and optimize the overall system for improved user experience. Effective webstack monitoring plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and performance of web applications, enabling rapid detection and resolution of issues to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience.

Background Context
------------------

“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:
 -   Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
 -   Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
